# React + TypeScript version of Scrimba Tenzies

This is the solo project from Scrimba Learn TypeScript course.

I already had the boilerplate code written is JS. This was a practice for me to refactort the whole app to TS. I have also had the opportunity to extract the compononent from App.tsx to the components folder.

I have used forwardRef in order to learn backward compatibility, although it is deprecated in React 19.
